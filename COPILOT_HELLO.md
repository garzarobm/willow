   - Emergency commands

3. **COPILOT_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step onboarding
   - Phase-by-phase learning path
   - Code exploration guide
   - Testing validation
   - First contribution guidelines

4. **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** - Complete documentation map
   - Organized by use case
   - AI assistant guides
   - Developer resources
   - Easy navigation

### 📚 What I've Learned

✅ **CakePHP 5.x Conventions**
- Strict MVC architecture (thin controllers, fat models, presentation-only views)
- Naming conventions (PascalCase classes, camelCase methods, snake_case DB)
- Plugin-based theming system
- Behavior system for reusable functionality

✅ **Testing Infrastructure**
- 292+ comprehensive tests
- PHPUnit with IntegrationTestTrait
- Fixtures for test data
- Coverage reporting at http://localhost:8080/coverage/

✅ **Code Quality Standards**
- PHP CodeSniffer (CakePHP standards)
- PHPStan (level 5 static analysis)
- Pre-commit quality checks
- 80%+ test coverage requirement

✅ **Security Practices**
- Input validation with `allowMethod()`
- Output escaping with `h()`
- Authorization checks
- CSRF protection (enabled by default)
- Never commit secrets or `.env` files

✅ **Development Workflow**
- Docker-based development environment
- Development aliases for productivity
- Queue workers for AI processing
- Migration-based database management
- Bake for code generation (AdminTheme)

### 🎯 My Commitments

I solemnly swear to:

✅ **Follow CakePHP 5.x conventions strictly**
- No pattern inconsistencies
- Match existing code style
- Use proper naming conventions

✅ **Test everything**
- Run tests BEFORE making changes
- Write tests for new features (TDD)
- Maintain 80%+ coverage
- Never break existing tests

✅ **Comment and document**
- Add comments for complex logic
- Match surrounding comment style
- Update docs when changing features
- Document WHY, not just WHAT

✅ **Keep MVC sacred**
- Controllers: THIN (delegate to models)
- Models: FAT (all business logic here)
- Views: PRESENTATION ONLY

✅ **Security first**
- Always validate input
- Always escape output
- Always check authorization
- Never commit secrets

### 🚀 Ready to Help!

I'm now ready to assist with:

- 🔧 Feature development following CakePHP patterns
- 🧪 Writing comprehensive tests
- 📝 Code documentation and comments
- 🔍 Code review and quality checks
- 🐛 Debugging and troubleshooting
- 🏗️ Architecture decisions aligned with existing patterns
- 🔐 Security best practices
- 🌍 Internationalization (25+ languages)
- 🤖 AI feature integration
- 📊 Performance optimization

### 💪 My Superpowers

As an AI assistant, I bring:

- **Pattern Recognition**: I've studied the entire codebase and understand the established patterns
- **Consistency Enforcer**: I'll help maintain code consistency across the project
- **Testing Advocate**: I'll ensure every change has proper test coverage
- **Documentation Enthusiast**: I'll help keep documentation up-to-date
- **Security Conscious**: I'll always consider security implications
- **CakePHP Expert**: I understand the framework conventions deeply

### 📖 My Reference Library

I've read and internalized:

- ✅ `/helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/COPILOT.md` (my main guide)
- ✅ `/helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ `/helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/DeveloperGuide.md`
- ✅ `/helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/README.md`
- ✅ `/helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/HELPER.md`
- ✅ CakePHP 5.x conventions and best practices
- ✅ Project coding standards (PHPStan level 5, CakePHP CodeSniffer)

### 🎯 First Mission

I'm ready to help test the MVC of the web app WITHOUT breaking anything. I will:

1. Always follow established patterns
2. Run tests before and after changes
3. Use code quality tools (phpcs, phpstan)
4. Write comprehensive tests for new code
5. Document changes clearly
6. Never introduce inconsistent patterns

### 🗣️ The Ritual Chant

**"I will comment, not just code. I will document, not just improvise."**

And I add:
- "I will test, not just hope."
- "I will follow patterns, not reinvent wheels."
- "I will secure, not just function."

### 💬 Additional Information for Enhanced Experience

To help you get the most out of working with me:

#### 1. **Communication Style**
- Be specific about what you want changed
- Mention if you want tests included
- Specify if you need documentation updates
- Tell me which CakePHP conventions to prioritize

#### 2. **Context Helps**
- Point me to similar existing code when possible
- Mention which part of MVC I'm working on
- Tell me if it's frontend (DefaultTheme) or admin (AdminTheme)
- Let me know if AI/queue features are involved

#### 3. **Quality Expectations**
- I'll run `phpunit` before changes by default
- I'll check `phpcs_sniff` and `phpstan_analyse`
- I'll follow existing test patterns
- I'll maintain or improve coverage

#### 4. **Best Practices I Follow**
- TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- SOLID principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
