## üéØ Key Learnings Documented

### CakePHP 5.x Architecture
‚úÖ Strict MVC patterns (thin controllers, fat models, presentation-only views)  
‚úÖ Naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case)  
‚úÖ Plugin-based theming system  
‚úÖ Behavior system for reusable functionality  
‚úÖ Queue-based processing for AI features  

### Testing Requirements
‚úÖ 292+ comprehensive tests  
‚úÖ PHPUnit with IntegrationTestTrait  
‚úÖ Fixtures for test data  
‚úÖ 80%+ coverage requirement  
‚úÖ TDD approach (test-first development)  

### Code Quality Standards
‚úÖ PHP CodeSniffer (CakePHP standards)  
‚úÖ PHPStan (level 5 static analysis)  
‚úÖ Pre-commit quality checks  
‚úÖ Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

### Security Practices
‚úÖ Input validation with `allowMethod()`  
‚úÖ Output escaping with `h()`  
‚úÖ Authorization checks  
‚úÖ CSRF protection  
‚úÖ Never commit secrets

## üí° Recommendations for Enhanced Experience

### 1. **Development Workflow**

**Recommendation**: Always run baseline tests before making changes
```bash
# Check current state
phpunit
phpcs_sniff
phpstan_analyse
```

**Why**: Understanding the baseline helps avoid breaking existing functionality.

### 2. **Use Development Aliases**

**Recommendation**: Install dev aliases immediately
```bash
./setup_dev_aliases.sh
```

**Why**: Makes development 10x faster with shortcuts like `phpunit`, `phpcs_fix`, etc.

### 3. **Queue Workers for AI Features**

**Recommendation**: Always run queue workers when testing AI features
```bash
cake_queue_worker_verbose
```

**Why**: AI features (alt text generation, translations, etc.) run asynchronously.

### 4. **Documentation Navigation**

**Recommendation**: Bookmark these files
- `AI_ASSISTANT_ONBOARDING.md` - Quick start
- `helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/COPILOT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Daily commands
- `helper-files(use-only-if-you-get-lost)/docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Navigation hub

**Why**: Fast access to commonly needed information.

### 5. **Code Generation**

**Recommendation**: Always use `--theme AdminTheme` for admin controllers
```bash
cake_shell bake controller Dogs --theme AdminTheme
```

**Why**: Ensures consistency with the project's theming system.

### 6. **Testing Strategy**

**Recommendation**: Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development)
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

**Why**: Prevents bugs and ensures maintainability.

### 7. **Context for AI Assistants**

**Recommendation**: When requesting help, provide:
- Which MVC component you're working on
- Whether it's frontend (DefaultTheme) or admin (AdminTheme)
- If AI/queue features are involved
- Links to similar existing code

**Why**: Better context = better assistance.

### 8. **Code Review Process**

**Recommendation**: Before committing, use the pre-commit checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code standards pass
- [ ] Static analysis passes
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No secrets committed

**Why**: Maintains code quality and prevents issues.
