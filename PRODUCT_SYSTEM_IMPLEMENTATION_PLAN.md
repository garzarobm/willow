# PRODUCT_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the new Product System in the Willow CMS, starting from version tag `v1.4.0`. The plan follows CakePHP conventions and is broken down into three developmental phases, each with clear deliverables and testing strategies. The system will introduce new tables as defined in the `V2` migration and add a new Product tab in the admin interface for CRUD operations and visualization.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Table Creation (Days 1-10)

### Goals
- Set up all new database tables as defined in `config/Migrations/20250731071418_V2.php`:
  - connector_types
  - product_affiliate_links
  - product_categories
  - product_connectors
  - product_reviews
  - product_specifications
- Scaffold CakePHP models, entities, and tables for each new table.
- Create basic CakePHP admin controllers and views for each table (CRUD operations).
- Ensure all code follows CakePHP conventions and is PSR-12 compliant.

### Deliverables
- Migration applied and verified.
- Models, Entities, and Tables for each new table.
- Admin controllers and basic views (index, view, add, edit, delete) for each table.
- Unit tests for models and controllers (where applicable).

### Testing
- PHPUnit unit tests for all models and controllers.
- Manual verification of CRUD operations in the admin interface.

---

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion (Days 11-20, no new tests after Day 11)

### Goals
- Expand admin interface for better usability:
  - Add search, filter, and pagination to all product-related admin pages.
  - Add relationships between tables (e.g., categories to products, connectors to products).
  - Add validation and CakePHP behaviors (Timestamp, Sluggable, etc.) as needed.
- Refine UI/UX for the new Product tab in the admin interface.
- Document all new features and update developer documentation.

### Deliverables
- Enhanced admin UI for all product tables.
- Relationships and behaviors implemented in models.
- Documentation updated.

### Testing
- No new tests written after Day 11.
- Continue to run and maintain existing unit tests.
- Manual QA for new features.

---

## Phase 3: Integration & Visualization (Days 21-30, focus on integration testing)

### Goals
- Implement integration tests for all product-related admin features.
- Add a new Product tab in the admin interface:
  - Centralized dashboard for all product tables.
  - CRUD operations for each table from the Product tab.
  - Visualization of data (tables, relationships, statistics, etc.).
- Ensure all features are robust and production-ready.

### Deliverables
- Product tab in admin interface with full CRUD and visualization for:
  - connector_types
  - product_affiliate_links
  - product_categories
  - product_connectors
  - product_reviews
  - product_specifications
- Integration tests for all product features.
- Final documentation and user guide.

### Testing
- PHPUnit integration tests for all admin product features.
- Manual end-to-end testing of the Product tab and all CRUD/visualization features.

---

## CakePHP Conventions
- Use CakePHP ORM for all database interactions.
- Follow CakePHP controller/view/model structure.
- Use CakePHP helpers and components for UI and logic reuse.
- Adhere to PSR-12 and CakePHP coding standards.

---

## Timeline Summary
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-10):** Foundation, migrations, scaffolding, unit tests.
- **Phase 2 (Days 11-20):** Feature expansion, UI/UX, documentation, no new tests after Day 11.
- **Phase 3 (Days 21-30):** Integration, visualization, integration tests, final polish.

---

## Notes
- All development should be thoroughly tested and peer-reviewed.
- Use CakePHP's bake tool where possible to speed up scaffolding.
- Integration tests in Phase 3 should cover all CRUD and visualization flows in the Product tab.
